//Question #1
//As a day-to-day activity, you will have to work with existing enterprise code and be able to figure out what it is doing.
//  See the attached file (sampleCode_js.txt). It contains one JS function from a real project. Name of that function was changed, and all comments were removed. The function also calls some other functions. Their code is not provided in the file, but you can rely on their names.
//  Try to describe what this function does. No need to comment every line and describe everything in details. 5-6 sentences should be enough.
